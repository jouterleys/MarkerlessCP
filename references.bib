abstract = {Kinematic analysis is a useful and widespread tool used in research and clinical biomechanics for the quantification of human movement. Common marker-based optical motion capture systems are time intensive and require highly trained operators to obtain kinematic data. Markerless motion capture systems offer an alternative method for the measurement of kinematic data with several practical benefits. This work compared the kinematics of human gait measured using a deep learning algorithm-based markerless motion capture system to those from a standard marker-based motion capture system. Thirty healthy adult participants walked on a treadmill while data were simultaneously recorded using eight video cameras and seven infrared optical motion capture cameras, providing synchronized markerless and marker-based data for comparison. The average root mean square distance (RMSD) between corresponding joint centers was less than 2.5 cm for all joints except the hip, which was 3.6 cm. Lower limb segment angles relative to the global coordinate system indicated the global segment pose estimates from both systems were very similar, with RMSD of less than 5.5° for all segment angles except those that represent rotations about the long axis of the segment. Lower limb joint angles captured similar patterns for flexion/extension at all joints, ab/adduction at the knee and hip, and toe-in/toe-out at the ankle. These findings indicate that the markerless system would be a suitable alternative technology in cases where the practical benefits of markerless data collection are preferred.}

abstract = {The clinical uptake and influence of gait analysis has been hindered by inherent limitations of marker-based motion capture systems, which have long been the standard method for the collection of gait data including kinematics. Markerless motion capture offers an alternative method for the collection of gait kinematics that presents several practical benefits over marker-based systems. This work aimed to determine the reliability of lower limb gait kinematics from video based markerless motion capture using an established experimental protocol for testing reliability. Eight healthy adult participants performed three sessions of five over-ground walking trials in their own self-selected clothing, separated by an average of 8.5 days, while eight synchronized and calibrated cameras recorded video. Three-dimensional pose estimates from the video data were used to compute lower limb joint angles. Inter-session variability, inter-trial variability, and the variability ratio were used to assess the reliability of the gait kinematics. Compared to repeatability studies based on marker-based motion capture, inter-trial variability was slightly greater than previously reported for some angles, with an average across all joint angles of 2.5°. Inter-session variability was smaller on average than all previously reported values, with an average across all joint angles of 2.8°. Variability ratios were all smaller than those previously reported with an average of 1.1, indicating that the multi-session protocol increased the total variability of joint angles by 10% of the inter-trial variability. These results indicate that gait kinematics can be reliably measured using markerless motion capture.}

abstract = {Spatiotemporal parameters can characterize the gait patterns of individuals, allowing assessment of their health status and detection of clinically meaningful changes in their gait. Video-based markerless motion capture is a user-friendly, inexpensive, and widely applicable technology that could reduce the barriers to measuring spatiotemporal gait parameters in clinical and more diverse settings. Two studies were performed to determine whether gait parameters measured using markerless motion capture demonstrate concurrent validity with those measured using marker-based motion capture and a pressure-sensitive gait mat. For the first study, thirty healthy young adults performed treadmill gait at self-selected speeds while marker-based motion capture and synchronized video data were recorded simultaneously. For the second study, twenty-five healthy young adults performed over-ground gait at self-selected speeds while footfalls were recorded using a gait mat and synchronized video data were recorded simultaneously. Kinematic heel-strike and toe-off gait events were used to identify the same gait cycles between systems. Nine spatiotemporal gait parameters were measured by each system and directly compared between systems. Measurements were compared using Bland-Altman methods, mean differences, Pearson correlation coefficients, and intraclass correlation coefficients. The results indicate that markerless measurements of spatiotemporal gait parameters have good to excellent agreement with marker-based motion capture and gait mat systems, except for stance time and double limb support time relative to both systems and stride width relative to the gait mat. These findings indicate that markerless motion capture can adequately measure spatiotemporal gait parameters of healthy young adults during treadmill and over-ground gait.}
